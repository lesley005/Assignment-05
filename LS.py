# Least squares approximation of fixed order. By L. van Veen, Ontario Tech U, 2026.

# Function to compute the least-squares polynomial approximant of order o to date (x_i,y_i), i=0..n.
# In: np arrays of floats x and y hold the data, o (positive integer) is the order of the approximant.
# Out: function handle P for the least-squares approximant.
